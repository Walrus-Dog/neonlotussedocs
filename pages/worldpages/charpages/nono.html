                <h1>Nono</h1>
                <p>Nono (乃々) Akikaze (秋風) is the protagonist and playable character in the game. She is the leader of Team 7. She speaks with a deeper tone and sometimes a slight Japanese accent.</p>
                <h3>Apperance</h3>
                <p>Nono has dark short messy hair and bright orange eyes. She has crossed side bangs and fitting bangs in the middle. Atop her head are a pair of cat ears that are the same dark color as her hair. The tip of her right ear and tail feature orange highlights that are the same color as her eyes.</p>
                <h3>Clothing</h3>
                <p>Undetermined. Will consist of some sort of sports wear for running and activity. Probably either leggings or “ninja pants” with a hoodie or zip up jacket and running sneakers.</p>
                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>Nono is a rather cheerful and optimistic person. Typically a chatterbox, her positive energy comes across to those she encounters, for better or worse. She has a love for exploration and is known to get into trouble due to her prowess to get into anything to accomplish her goal. When pressed she has a realistic outlook on most things, which can break her optimistic demeanor. (This will probably change)</p>
                <h3>Lore</h3>
                <p>Nono Akikaze is the eldest of 5 siblings. Her family is an ancient samurai family from the Hiroshima area. Her clan has a long history of working with and at times hunting Other. At several points being employed by the Imperial family themselves. Born in Hiroshima herself, her family introduced her to the occult at a young age. She has grown up around the Other and sees them as people like anyone else. Joining the Tokyo branch of OFFAIR, she put her great skills and knowledge of Other to work and now leads Team 7. Helping to keep Other in check and stop major spiritual events from harming the general public, Nono and her team work to study, contain and protect Other. Acting as a sort of “fixer”, she generally does what she can to solve occult problems and find middle ground between groups to preserve peace.</p>
