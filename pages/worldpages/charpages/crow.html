                <h1>Crow</h1>
                <p>Crow, or Jichoukarasua no Ookami (慈鳥烏鴉乃大神), is a massive crow spirit. It is the leader of the city and starts as an antagonist. It speaks in a low voice and only in very old Japanese.</p>
                <h3>Apperance</h3>
                <p>Crow looks like most corvids, being solid black. It is much larger than a normal bird, but changes size at will. It can be building size or normal bird size if it wishes. On its body and legs hang various shinto talismans and papers. Its beak has kanji inscribed on it as well as talisman hanging off. Its beak is also slightly damaged, having chunks missing from the edges. Around its neck is a large shimenawa.</p>
                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>Crow is initially antagonistic towards Nono. She does not belong in its realm and it wants her gone. It plays tricks on her and scares her to get her to leave. To its subjects that it protects, Crow is a very kind spirit. It used its power to create the city and allowed wayward yokai to inhabit it. It eventually realizes that the Suit is trying to actually harm Nono, and saves her from it at the end.</p>
                <h3>Lore</h3>
                <p>A spirit so old that few know of its true origins, Crow started its existence like all other spirits. Farmers prayed to the birds to remove a particularly bad parasite infection. Crow awoke to their praying and served as the village's little crop guardian for centuries. Eventually becoming so ubiquitous that other villages started deifying it, it grew in power exponentially. In the 1800s there was a steep decline in the prayers that Crow started to receive. For so long it had been fed by peoples hope and dreams and it now found itself totally dry. It took the spirit a while to realize that it had to do something. In the 2000s it used a chunk of its enormous power to create a realm. A realm for all of the other forgotten spirits that no longer hsd prayers sent to them. This city was modeled after the modern human architecture and now acts as the home for millions of displaced spirits. Only spirits are allowed in freely, any human must be allowed and are closely watched unless trusted. When the realms cross at times humans have been known to slip in. Those who have dobutsu quality are more likely to slip through.</p>
